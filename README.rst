vim-plugin-starter-kit
======================

|Build Status|

Get productive a little faster
------------------------------

I created the vim-plugin-starter-kit to help speed up development and
perhaps shorten the learning curve involved with writing Vim plugins.

Installation
------------

``pip install vim-plugin-starter-kit``

Usage
-----

Run ``vim-plugin-starter-kit`` from the command line. Once you answer a
few questions you will have all that you need to immediately get started
writing a new Vim plugin with the Python language. The resulting
directory will contain scaffolding for documentation, testing, and your
.py and .vim files customized for your specified project name. The files
will contain working examples you can use as reference as you begin
writing your plugin.

Wiki
----

As you're are getting started check out the `Wiki`_
for more examples of usage of common interactions between Python scripts with
the Vim buffer.

But Wait There Is More
----------------------

Ever wonder how to get started writing your own vim plugin? I gave a
talk where I use the starter-kit and walk through step by step writing
and testing a complete plugin. Check it out `here`_
